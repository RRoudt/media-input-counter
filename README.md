# Media input counter

## About this project

This simple counter is based on the [passenger counter project by Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pY5b7sQ). It provides a simple counter that increments by 5 minutes, can save the total amount of input, and reset.

The input counter also calculates the "net input time," which is set to 67% of the total input time. This net time is to account for parts without dialogue in TV shows and movies.
